What follows is a list of customizations made, and the resources I used to make them.

1. One thing missing “out of the box” is a linked category or tag list in the sidebar. Dan Watson [explains](http://www.dotnetguy.co.uk/post/2012/06/25/octopress-category-list-plugin/) just how to do this, and it works. Yeah!

2. Rake new_post does not work with zsh.
This error can be resolved with the following [work around](http://ryanarneson.com/blog/2012/04/07/rake-new-post-doesnt-work-with-zsh/)

2. Building a [Contact Form - Part One](http://www.donothackcore.com/blog/2012/05/06/contact-form-in-octopress)
using [Google Docs](https://github.com/arshad/Google-Form-Octopress)

Adding notifications to the [Contact Form - Part Two](http://www.donothackcore.com/blog/2012/05/07/contact-form-in-octopress-making-notifications-awesomer/)
