I am currently using an iMac (early 2009) with Lion 10.7.4 installed. I find myself constantly downloading and trying out new software, most of which does not end up being used beyond the trail period. I also seem to install and reinstall a lot of stuff from the Terminal on account of making a lot of neewbie mistakes.<!-- more -->

I am not sure how all of this activity impacts the Mac, but it does seem to get sluggish after awhile, and so I have been rebuilding this machine every spring, getting rid of all the crud and starting with a fresh [clean install](http://mashable.com/2011/07/20/lion-clean-install-guide/?utm_source=iphoneapp).

I begin by downloading OS X from the App Store and making a [bootable installer](http://osxdaily.com/2011/07/08/make-a-bootable-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-installer-from-a-usb-flash-drive/) with a USB 8GB flash drive. Using [time machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(Mac_OS), I back everything up, and double check that I have, in fact, backed everything up.

Following these [directions](http://osxdaily.com/2011/06/21/mac-os-x-lion-clean-install-explained/), I restart the Mac, holding down the option key so that the computer boots from the external drive, and proceed to reinstall the OS X.

After the install, I have a computer with an operating system, some default programs and that is about it, a lean clean machine. I can now begin reinstalling only those items I need or want.

Since I am a Wannabe Web Designer and Developer, my subsequent installs involve creating a development environment that will allow me to build websites from scratch using predominately [open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).
