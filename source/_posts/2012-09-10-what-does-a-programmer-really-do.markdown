So how *do you* describe what a computer programmer really does in his/her day-to-day work?

Wikipedia describes [computer programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming#Programmers) as the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of a computer program, that is not very helpful!<!-- more -->

Ka Wai Cheung in his book, [The Developer's Code: What Real Programmers Do](/resources), describes software development as being similar to writing a novel or composing music.

Wow, some mental imagery, I must be getting closer.

Cheung goes on to say, that an author might write a chapter outline to get a general guide about what she wants to write about. But after that, she starts writing the real thing. Then she edits and repeats, a word change here or an entire chapter removed there. 

And, a musician does not write sheet music for months and then hopes that the notes sound right. Instead, he plays and plays and finds a riff that works. He might have a few lines of lyrics and then finds the right chords around it, or vice versa. He builds the song in pieces and tests it in pieces. 

These two analogies are excellent and really describe my own experiences. I have written a book, I play guitar, and now I am programming... these are all fundamentally very similar activities.

It's storytelling!
