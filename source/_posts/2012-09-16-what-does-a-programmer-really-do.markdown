So how *do you* describe what a computer programmer really does?

Wikipedia describes [computer programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming#Programmers) as the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of a computer program, but this definition doesn't help me very much.<!-- more -->

Ka Wai Cheung in his book, [The Developer's Code: What Real Programmers Do](/resources), describes software development as being similar to writing a novel or composing music.

Cheung goes on to say, that an author might write a chapter outline to get a general guide about what she wants to write about. But after that, she starts writing the real thing. Then she edits and repeats, a word change here or an entire chapter removed there. 

And, a musician does not write sheet music for months and then hopes that the notes sound right. Instead, he plays and plays and finds a riff that works. He might have a few lines of lyrics and then finds the right chords around it, or vice versa. He builds the song in pieces and tests it in pieces. 

The activities of a coder, novelist and musician are all very similar, each respective craft involves taking the audience (whether viewer, reader, or listener) from a starting point and engaging them through to an end point.

At its core, programming (at least in the context of building a website) is about [storytelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling); a means of conveying the events, words, images and sounds needed to share a particular experience whether it be of an entertainment, educational or commercial purpose.

This may, in part, explain why many of us appreciate a great [commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib-Qiyklq-Q) from [Coca Cola](http://www.coca-cola.com/en/index.html).

Or a great [guitar riff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CdopMJu7r4&feature=related) from [Keith Richards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps3717fqlkY&feature=related).
