I have visited more than 20 of the 58 [national parks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States) found in the US. 

Throughout these parks are many walking and hiking trails and at the start of these trails would be a sign that read:<!-- more -->

Now, I am far from being a naturalist, I am certainly no [John Muir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir) but this phrase has stuck with me and greatly influenced my thinking.

First, I grow very weary of all the signs we see, telling us to slow down, speed up, don't go here, don't go there, can't do this, can't do that...

What is very smart about this sign, is that it doesn't feel like a rule.
