Now, I am far from being a naturalist, I am certainly no [John Muir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir) but this phrase has stuck with me and has influenced my thinking.

It's great to see a sign that can influence your behaviour without hitting you over the head with it. 

The idea that you can leave something in the same condition as you first experienced it, conveys a deep feeling of respect without shoving it up your face.
