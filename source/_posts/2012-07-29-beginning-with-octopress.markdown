A few months ago, I was looking for a blogging tool and stumbled upon [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which as of late, has been receiving considerable attention.<!-- more -->

The [documentation](http://octopress.org/docs/) reads great for developers, but for non-IT guys like me, it does not feel complete.

If you are new to this stuff, you may want to add a few proficiencies to the [setup page](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/) including: HTML, CSS, SASS, Ruby, Jekyll, Liquid and Markdown.

Once you create your new blog, study the contents of the root folder, and learn how the pieces all fit together. 

In reading a lot of new Octopress blogs, a large number of developers have commented on how they were able to set up their site in a matter of hours, this reminds me of the hype around creating a blog with Ruby on Rails in 15 minutes.

People learning these tools, technologies and methodologies for the first time will spend a day for every hour a seasoned professional will spend.
