A few months ago, I was looking for a blogging tool and stumbled upon [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which has been receiving a lot of attention.

The documentation sounds great for developers, but for non-IT guys like me, it may not fill in all of the gaps.

If you are new to this stuff, you may want to add a few proficiencies to the [setup page](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/) including: HTML, CSS, SASS, Ruby, Jekyll, Liquid and Markdown.

In addition, you will want to have some familiarity with how all these pieces fit together. A large number of bloggers have commented on how they were able to set up their site in a matter of hours. 

I have made several customizations and I am writing my fifth post and it has taken the entire Labour Day Weekend!
