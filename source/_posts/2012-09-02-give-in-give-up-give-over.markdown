In the late sixties, [Timothy Leary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary) popularized the phrase "turn on, tune in, drop out" *apparently* given to him by [Marshall McLuhan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan), known for coining famous expressions like "the medium is the message" and "the global village".

Well, I'm certainly no McLuhan, but I too have come up with a new phrase:<!-- more -->

>Give In, Give Up, Give Over

When you're weary, feeling small, when tears are in your eyes, when times get rough, and friends just can't be found, when you're down and out, when you're on the street, when evening falls so hard, when darkness comes, and pain is all around, give in, give up, and give over, you will feel better in the morning.

Obviously, this is [tongue-and-check](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek). [Simon and Garfunkel's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Garfunkel) fifth and final studio album [Bridge Over Troubled Water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_Over_Troubled_Water) and, in particular, the song by the [same name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_over_Troubled_Water_(song) is a  brilliant work of art.
