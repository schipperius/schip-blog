[Timothy Leary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary) popularized the phrase "turn on, tune in, drop out" apparently given to him by [Marshall McLuhan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan), known for coining famous expressions like "the medium is the message" and "the global village".

Well, I'm no McLuhan, but I too have coined a new phrase:<!-- more -->

>Give In, Give Up, Give Over

When you're weary, feeling small, when tears are in your eyes, when times get rough, and friends just can't be found, when you're down and out, when you're on the street, when evening falls so hard, when darkness comes, and pain is all around, give in, give up, and give over, you will feel better in the morning.

I would like to thank [Simon and Garfunkel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Garfunkel) for their fifth and final studio album [Bridge Over Troubled Water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_Over_Troubled_Water) and the song by the [same name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_over_Troubled_Water_(song)) for another bout of depressed inspiration.
