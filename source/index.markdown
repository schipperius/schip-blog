In late July 2008, I had no IT skills what-so-ever, I had written a book a few years earlier and wanted to put it up on the Web. Easy, or so I thought. I bought Elizabeth Castro’s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0321430840/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=0321430840&linkCode=as2&tag=booofjac-20">HTML, XHTML, and CSS</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.ca/e/ir?t=booofjac-20&l=as2&o=15&a=0321430840" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and began learning web design.

In August 2010, I jumped into the Ruby and Rails environment, and now almost four years into this world wide web, I thought I would write about my observations and learning experiences.

Does the Internet need another blog on web development? I don’t think so, but I do think I am able to provide a perspective that is currently missing: the non-IT entry into web development.

Hopefully this blog will help other folks out in the same way that so many authors, writers and bloggers continue to help me.

Cheers,

Mark
