In late July 2008, I had no IT skills what-so-ever, I had written a book a few years earlier and wanted to put it up on the Web. Easy, or so I thought. I bought Elizabeth Castro’s book, [HTML, XHTML, and CSS](/resources) and began learning web design.

In August 2010, I jumped into the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) environment, and now almost four years into the the [World Wide Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), I thought I would write (and share) my observed learning experiences.

Does the [Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) need another blog on web development? I don’t think so, but I do think I am able to provide a certain perspective that currently seems to be missing: the non-IT entry into web design and development.

My hope is that this blog will help out other folks, in the same way that so many [resources](/resources) continue to help me in becoming better at my craft.

Cheers,

Mark
