In late July 2008, I had no IT skills what-so-ever, I had written a book a few years earlier and wanted to put it up on the Web. Easy, or so I thought. I bought Elizabeth Castro’s book, [HTML, XHTML, and CSS](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0321430840/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=0321430840&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booofjac-20) and began learning web design.

In August 2010, I jumped into the Ruby and Rails environment, and now almost four years into this world wide web, I thought I would write about my observations and learning experiences.

Does the Internet need another blog on web development? I don’t think so, but I do think I am able to provide a perspective that is currently missing: the non-IT entry into web development.

Hopefully this blog will help other folks out in the same way that so many authors, writers and bloggers continue to help me.

Cheers,

Mark
