    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, I was looking for a blogging tool and stumbled upon <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> which has been receiving a lot of attention.</p>

<p>The documentation sounds great for developers, but for non-IT guys like me, it may not fill in all of the gaps.</p>

<p>If you are new to this stuff, you may want to add a few proficiencies to the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">setup page</a> including: HTML, CSS, SASS, Ruby, Jekyll, Liquid and Markdown.</p>

<p>In addition, you will want to have some familiarity with how all these pieces fit together. A large number of bloggers have commented on how they were able to set up their site in a matter of hours.</p>

<p>I have made several customizations and I am writing my fifth post and it has taken the entire Labour Day Weekend!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One thing missing “out of the box” is a linked category or tag list in the sidebar. Dan Watson <a href="http://www.dotnetguy.co.uk/post/2012/06/25/octopress-category-list-plugin/">explains</a> just how to do this, and it works. Yeah!</p></li>
<li><p>Rake new_post does not work with zsh.
This error can be resolved with the following <a href="http://ryanarneson.com/blog/2012/04/07/rake-new-post-doesnt-work-with-zsh/">work around</a></p></li>
