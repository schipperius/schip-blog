    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So how <em>do you</em> describe what a computer programmer really does in his/her day-to-day work?</p>

<p>Wikipedia describes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming#Programmers">computer programming</a> as the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of a computer program, that is not very helpful!<!-- more --></p>

<p>Ka Wai Cheung in his book, <a href="/resources">The Developer's Code: What Real Programmers Do</a>, describes software development as being similar to writing a novel or composing music.</p>

<p>Wow, some mental imagery, I must be getting closer.</p>

<p>Cheung goes on to say, that an author might write a chapter outline to get a general guide about what she wants to write about. But after that, she starts writing the real thing. Then she edits and repeats, a word change here or an entire chapter removed there.</p>

<p>And, a musician does not write sheet music for months and then hopes that the notes sound right. Instead, he plays and plays and finds a riff that works. He might have a few lines of lyrics and then finds the right chords around it, or vice versa. He builds the song in pieces and tests it in pieces.</p>

<p>These two analogies are excellent and really describe my own experiences. I have written a book, I play guitar, and now I am programming... these are all fundamentally very similar activities.</p>

<p>It's storytelling!</p>
