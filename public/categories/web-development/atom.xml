    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So how <em>do you</em> describe what a computer programmer really does?</p>

<p>Wikipedia describes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming#Programmers">computer programming</a> as the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of a computer program, but this definition doesn't help me very much.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Ka Wai Cheung in his book, <a href="/resources">The Developer's Code: What Real Programmers Do</a>, describes software development as being similar to writing a novel or composing music.</p>

<p>Cheung goes on to say, that an author might write a chapter outline to get a general guide about what she wants to write about. But after that, she starts writing the real thing. Then she edits and repeats, a word change here or an entire chapter removed there.</p>

<p>And, a musician does not write sheet music for months and then hopes that the notes sound right. Instead, he plays and plays and finds a riff that works. He might have a few lines of lyrics and then finds the right chords around it, or vice versa. He builds the song in pieces and tests it in pieces.</p>

<p>The activities of a coder, novelist and musician are all very similar, each respective craft involves taking the audience (whether viewer, reader, or listener) from a starting point and engaging them through to an end point.</p>

<p>At its core, programming (at least in the context of building a website) is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling">storytelling</a>; a means of conveying the events, words, images and sounds needed to share a particular experience whether it be of an entertainment, educational or commercial purpose.</p>

<p>This may, in part, explain why many of us appreciate a great <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib-Qiyklq-Q">commercial</a> from <a href="http://www.coca-cola.com/en/index.html">Coca Cola</a>.</p>

<p>Or a great <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CdopMJu7r4&amp;feature=related">guitar riff</a> from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps3717fqlkY&amp;feature=related">Keith Richards</a>.</p>

<li><p>One thing missing “out of the box” is a linked category or tag list in the sidebar. Dan Watson <a href="http://www.dotnetguy.co.uk/post/2012/06/25/octopress-category-list-plugin/">explains</a> just how to do this, and it works. Yeah!</p></li>
<li><p>Rake new_post does not work with zsh.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, I was looking for a blogging tool and stumbled upon <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> which as of late, has been receiving considerable attention.<!-- more --></p>

<p>The <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">documentation</a> reads great for developers, but for non-IT guys like me, it does not feel complete.</p>

<p>If you are new to this stuff, you may want to add a few proficiencies to the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">setup page</a> including: HTML, CSS, SASS, Ruby, Jekyll, Liquid and Markdown.</p>

<p>Once you create your new blog, study the contents of the root folder, and learn how the pieces all fit together.</p>

<p>In reading a lot of new Octopress blogs, a large number of developers have commented on how they were able to set up their site in a matter of hours, this reminds me of the <a href="http://vimeo.com/5362441">hype</a> around creating a blog with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>People learning these tools, technologies and methodologies for the first time can easily expect to spend a day for every hour a seasoned professional will spend.</p>
